            History of CSS 
        </h2>

        <br>

        <p>
            In 1994, <strong>Hakon Wium Lie</strong>, a <em>Norwegian web pioneer</em>, and <strong>Bert Bos</strong>, a <em>Dutch programmer</em>, proposed the first CSS specification. Their vision was to separate <mark><u>content (HTML)</u></mark> from <mark><u>presentation (CSS)</u></mark>, thus simplifying web development and making it more flexible.

        </h2>

        <br>

        <p>
           Here we will show one HTML page displayed with four different stylesheets. Click on the "Stylesheet 1", "Stylesheet 2", "Stylesheet 3", "Stylesheet 4", links below to see the different styles:-

            Why Use CSS? 
        </h2>

        <br>

        <p>
            CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes. 
            <br>
            Example:-

        <h2>
            CSS Solved a Big Problem 
        </h2>

        <br>

        <p>
            HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page! 
            <br>
            HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:- 
            <br>
            &lt;h1&gt; This is a heading &lt;/h1&gt; 
            <br>
            &lt;p&gt; This is a pargraph. &lt;/p&gt; 

            <br>
            When tags like &lt;font&gt;, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process. 
            <br>
            To solve the problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS. 
            <br>
            CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page! 
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>
            CSS Saves a Lot of Work! 
        </h2>

        <br>

        <p>
            The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files. 
            <br>
            With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!
